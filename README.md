# Real-Time Object Tracking and Line Crossing Detection

The project involves using a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection in video frames or sequences of images, coupled with a custom object tracker to maintain the identities of detected objects across frames. The application is designed to process frames from a video feed or a sequence of images, detect objects, track them, and potentially send the locations of newly identified objects to a ground station.
